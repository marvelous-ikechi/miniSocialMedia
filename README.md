# My Expo Project

This project was booted with [Expo](https://expo.io/). It is a simple React Native app that demonstrates the use of firebase for authentication and firestore as a database. It is a simple messaging app. However, it has the following features:

- Authentication: SignIn and Login (using email and password).

- Messaging: Users can post a message to the group, automatically see the update without refreshing, and view messages from other users. The messaging feature, however, requires users authentication.

- Logout: Users can logout from the application.
